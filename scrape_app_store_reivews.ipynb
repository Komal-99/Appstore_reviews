On telling them that we cannot afford it they asked us to call our parents to pay the excess baggage fee. As our parents dont stay here, we briefed them about our situation that we had no money. The indigo manager at guwahati airport kept smiling and said I cannot do anything about it . That is not my problem. She asked us to take out 20 kgs and carry it if we cannot pay the excess baggage fees. They asked us to put 20 kgs in carry on baggage even when we did not have any luggage to put the 20 kgs. They told us to arrange it somehow and that it was not their problem.  We are entitled to 50 kgs per student fare and they kept demanding money for the extra 20kgs by charging us normal fare for 30 kgs. Very disappointing behavior by the airline. I would give you 0 stars if i could, but 1 is the least it allows me. Pure extortion scheme by indigo. This is extremely filthy behavior.

Despite requesting and confirming a wheelchair at the time of boarding, IndiGo denied the service on arrival, claiming it was not logged in their system.\\n\\nAfter repeated pleas, a wheelchair was briefly provided, only for staff to ask her to get up and walk immediately after deplaning. She was forced to walk across the runway and board a bus. At the terminal, we again requested a wheelchair. After 30 minutes, airport staff informed us that IndiGo had refused the request, leaving us to walk her all the way to the exit.\\n\\nThe lack of empathy and basic decency towards an elderly passenger was humiliating and inhumane. This experience has ensured we will never fly IndiGo again, and we strongly advise others to reconsider if travelling with vulnerable family members.',\n",

The app crashes or throws random errors midway.\\n\\t•\\tChecking in? Half the time, the boarding pass won’t generate, forcing you to queue at the airport like it’s 1999.\\n\\t•\\tManaging bookings? Want to modify a flight? You’ll either be stuck in an endless loading screen or redirected to an error message with zero explanation.\\n\\t•\\tPayment?

No Fixes, No Improvement\\n\\nDespite thousands of complaints, the app never gets better. Updates either break new things or fix nothing. IndiGo clearly doesn’t care about its digital experience, even though millions of passengers rely on it.\\n\\nFinal Verdict: Avoid at All Costs\\n\\nUse the desktop website (if you dare), or just accept your fate and visit the airport counter.

This forces you to either book some other flight or book the same one at a higher price. The computers are making a fool of the customers. Flight prices should be fairly determined as per flying time, distance, fuel cost and a factor for days before flight departure and vacancy on the flight. However, in their price model, and the current duopoly in market, flight prices are highly volatile and totally dependent on computer algorithms. The only fools in this entire system are the customers who are at the mercy of their computer systems.',\n",

When contacted cabin crew got statement “ I will inform technician, he will come and fix it”. The statement was naturally false as no technician visit on boarded plane for break fix repair and no one ever came. Upon reminding issue to second crew staff , got a statement that “Sir this aircraft is old, there are functionality issues.” This was a shocker and serious statement given by the staff, confessing the issues within aircraft and its poor maintenance. This really raises concern for safety and reliability of passengers and aircraft including crew members. Also observed, the crew ignoring us and rushing fast when passing by near our seats. They didn’t even shown courtesy to offer other available seats or upgrade as a compensation. Rather announcement was running to upgrade seat by paying additional charges. How pity !!! Never the less, it was a painful journey and highly unprofessional service experience. I would rather prefer any other international carrier to experience professional grade crew services and betterly managed aircrafts for safer and reliable journey for international destinations. Even for domestic services I would recommend alternative service providers.',\n",

She clearly and calmly explained the cause of the delay, the weather conditions along our route, and assured us of our safety. What stood out most was her ability to convey this information in a soothing and clear manner, all in Hindi. Unlike the often formal and impersonal tone used by many pilots, Captain Anita's approach was warm and reassuring. Her efforts to avoid further delays were also communicated effectively, making the entire situation far less stressful for all passengers. I truly appreciated her professionalism and the personal touch she brought to our flight. Thank you, Captain Anita, for a comfortable and reassuring journey. Yogesh and Anita Bhatnagar Jaipur\",\n",

The only choice left with airline functioning on so many Routes is Indigo.

Why the passengers travelling above a cut off day for a sector say 10000, not being the meal , though one on corporate booking, is getting all these services even if he has purchased for 6000\\nc.
