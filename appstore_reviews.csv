"I booked a flight through Indigo, the flight is run in partnership with Turkish Airlines. I have been trying to check in for more than an hour through both web and mobile app. This has been the most painful experience for me wrt using an app. The web does not let me move past passenger details and keeps giving me irrelevant error. When I try to check in in mobile app, it keeps giving me long form to enter all the passenger details and after that never enables the button to “Next”. It leaves me stuck on this page without any errors.
In “My Trips” section, I enter my ticket details to view the itinerary. I see an option to do web check in there but this workflow leads me to different erroneous page where it is not able to identify my seat selectio , which I already made at the time of booking. The “check in” workflow does identify my seat selection correctly, not sure why it fails when I come from “My Trip” workflow.

I am from software engineering background and do understand the technical details behind the application. At this point, I am seriously questioning the app developers, UX , QA and everyone involved in deliverying such poor customer experience.

Now if your card does not go thru (for some reason, mine did not, Im using USD as currency and a US card) they give you another chance - with 16 mins time limit this time for the payment transaction go thru, which is means - you wait again.

"We booked a ticket under students criteria where indigo states that it provides a 25kg baggage per student. We selected students did the tickets and when we reached the check in counter we were told that we aren’t booked under student even though we had all our student ids.

On telling them that we cannot afford it they asked us to call our parents to pay the excess baggage fee. As our parents dont stay here, we briefed them about our situation that we had no money. The indigo manager at guwahati airport kept smiling and said I cannot do anything about it . That is not my problem. She asked us to take out 20 kgs and carry it if we cannot pay the excess baggage fees. They asked us to put 20 kgs in carry on baggage even when we did not have any luggage to put the 20 kgs. They told us to arrange it somehow and that it was not their problem.  We are entitled to 50 kgs per student fare and they kept demanding money for the extra 20kgs by charging us normal fare for 30 kgs. Very disappointing behavior by the airline. I would give you 0 stars if i could, but 1 is the least it allows me. Pure extortion scheme by indigo. This is extremely filthy behavior.

"If there were an award for the most painfully horrible airline app, the IndiGo app would win it hands down. This app has been broken, slow, and unreliable for years, and somehow, it keeps getting worse.

What Doesn’t Work? Everything.
	•	Booking a flight? Good luck! The app crashes or throws random errors midway.
	•	Checking in? Half the time, the boarding pass won’t generate, forcing you to queue at the airport like it’s 1999.
	•	Managing bookings? Want to modify a flight? You’ll either be stuck in an endless loading screen or redirected to an error message with zero explanation.
	•	Payment? Cards get declined for no reason, UPI transactions fail, and sometimes, money gets deducted without confirming the booking.
	•	User Interface? Outdated, clunky, and as intuitive as an airline safety manual written in hieroglyphics.

This Isn’t a New Problem

It’s not like the app was great and suddenly deteriorated. It’s been like this for years! IndiGo, India’s largest airline, still can’t manage to develop an app that functions at even a basic level.

The Worst Part? No Fixes, No Improvement

Despite thousands of complaints, the app never gets better. Updates either break new things or fix nothing. IndiGo clearly doesn’t care about its digital experience, even though millions of passengers rely on it.

Final Verdict: Avoid at All Costs

Use the desktop website (if you dare), or just accept your fate and visit the airport counter. This app is beyond saving, and unless IndiGo invests in proper tech infrastructure, it’s a lost cause.",1,2025-02-03 19:15:02-07:00,Excrutiatingly horrible app,7.2.1,in,,

Firstly she was alone handling the wheel chair issuance with more than 10 people in Queue and on top of that she was enjoying solving the general queries of so many other standbys that wheelchair people were looking at her face like a farmer looks to the sky for rain!

"Well, I have traveled through Indigo airline multiple times. My recent experience was very poor customer service from the Ahmedabad domestic airport when I was traveling with my senior citizen parents for we are going for the Pilgrim. From Ahmedabad to Dehradun 23rd September 2 10 PM we were at the airport near 12:30 PM so there was a huge lane for check-in and before that like the baggage claim so we are in the lane and out of nowhere that lady called Number is +91 89767 31257 , she called from the above number and calling out of nowhere and telling me like where I am, I told we are putting bags on the belt. She told you have to check the next available flight, we clearly check there was one hour remaining and like even after like 40 to 45 minutes are remaining I have done baggage & check in ,staff was not properly helping and the lane was not moving. There was the human error, the first thing and before the 24 hours to 48 hours, I was not able to do the Web check-in. There was a technical error. It was not happening like neither from the website not from the application. Eventually, that lady was forcing her thoughts on us and we had to wait till 11 PM. We waited on the airport for nine hours and like our hotels were booked at the mussorie and we couldn’t use the first day of our journey. Because of that problem, our itinerary was in a bad shape, it started in the bad shape.

I recently booked a ticket. Before the applications recent update I don’t think there was a FREE seat option. After the update I noticed it and was actually glad they had 6 seats that were free of cost at the time of booking. Even when I selected the seats it showed ₹0 so I did not further check the final price because I knew there is a convenience fee so the overall price must be including that. Later when I checked the charges after paying is when I saw the extra fee for the “FREE” seat was added ₹256. I think in a way it’s a trap to just take more money from those who rely on this application for their convenience.

3. The App interface is so poor that you first get bombarded for partner and new bookings. The app is also for your existing customers for easy of travel. Completely missed the point in development cycle.

When contacted cabin crew got statement “ I will inform technician, he will come and fix it”. The statement was naturally false as no technician visit on boarded plane for break fix repair and no one ever came. Upon reminding issue to second crew staff , got a statement that “Sir this aircraft is old, there are functionality issues.” This was a shocker and serious statement given by the staff, confessing the issues within aircraft and its poor maintenance. This really raises concern for safety and reliability of passengers and aircraft including crew members. Also observed, the crew ignoring us and rushing fast when passing by near our seats. They didn’t even shown courtesy to offer other available seats or upgrade as a compensation. Rather announcement was running to upgrade seat by paying additional charges. How pity !!!

"I happen to fly twice or thrice during a month, and now almost for 20 years. I have seen good and bad all sorts of experiences while travelling thru various airlines . Over the years many new airlines emerged and few just vanished, due to various reasons. Today we as air passengers are left with very few choices as Air India is facing its own issues alongwith Vistara and air Asia , Akasa has just taken off, go Air is non functional and Spicejet also facing its own issues . The only choice left with airline functioning on so many Routes is Indigo. Most tge flights I take are by Indigo. 

Over few years, I have faced many issues in their customer service and the service they provide to their customers inflight.

For example while travelling to and fro Chandigarh and Bangalore, I faced similar issues in both the flights.

1. As my flight was at 8.30 am, from Chandigarh, despite my starting early I could reach airport at 7.30 and rushed to the boarding area, with a hope that I will get tea and snacks etc in the flight, though after making a payment. As tge staff started service, I requested for tea and snacks. I got an instant reply that the service is for pre booked meals and I would get after they are served. 
2. Same happened in the return flight.

I would like to ask the airline the following questions .

a. why the passengers on corporate code being allowed tkts at lower rate as also preferential seats and meals, whereas the other passengers despite paying more, are not getting the preferences 
b. Why the passengers travelling above a cut off day for a sector say 10000, not being the meal , though one on corporate booking, is getting all these services even if he has purchased for 6000
c. Are the travelers with no pre booking are second rate citizens.

I would like to know as to why the people booking at higher rates not entitled for any priority while those shelling out less amount

"Today I was travelling by Indigo connecting flight  . My flight was booked from Chandigarh to New Delhi which was scheduled to departure at 13:05 pm . My connecting flight was scheduled at 20:05 from New Delhi to AUH .

I had my PCR done on 24th at 15:35pm and I was confused about the rules and regulations about international travel. I called customer care on 24th asking them about the RT  PCR requirements  . They told me that it will be counted once the report is out and  not from the time of sample taken.

On 25th when I had received results just to clear my doubts  I again called indigo customer care and gave them full details about my sample taken and time of report being out.  My call was taken care by a lady by the name of Akanksha . She was although very polite and I had given feedback as well the way she had handled my call. I had asked her to please tell me if there is any problems in my current report timings and she could tell me that at that very moment so that I can take fresh PCR on 25th as I do not want any problems in my boarding but she said no to worry and go ahead with same report.

But today 26th February when I arrived at almost at 9:10 am at the airport , I was denied flight sighting that my sample taken is at 15:35 while my connecting flight is on 20:05 from Delhi and there was time gap. I informed the airport executives that  I had already cross checked about this from customer care executive yesterday and they told me not to worry and go ahead with same report  and there will be no issues. But the executives at the airport they told me to get a new report so that I could get boarding while not giving any details for further assistance. So I ran away to nearest hospital.
While I was getting the PCR done at nearby Hospital, I was informed by hospital staff that  report will arrive at 12 pm . After knowing which I called customer care again to update them about my whereabouts and chances of missing flight and help me out in that situation. 

The customer care executive was Aakash Dass. I told him the whole scenario  and told him about my whereabouts and chances of missing the flight due the report issue  I asked for his help if he can schedule me in any other immediate flight available today itself so that I can catch my next  flight . He told me there is no flight available today. Then asked him is there any solution as I have to catch the next flight anyhow and I am even ready to go by road.He said he can cancel my that flight and do partial refund of 31 aed. I said to him it’s of no use I asked him if he is sure if there is no flight available . He said there is no other flight available. In the last he asked me if he can start the partial refund then me having no option said yes. 

But to my shock , the passenger next to me was also in same situation , with same connecting flight and in same hospital and he was also on the a call with customer care at same time . But he was being given options for rescheduling  his flight  at 3:15pm.
 
There was only a gap of 2 minute between his call and my call . Upon hearing this I called the customer care back again and requested to speak to Aakash as he has told me incase I need more Assistance he could be forwarded the call to. But the new customer care executive said this is not possible. I asked him why my fellow passenger was given option of having another flight while I was denied. He said this is due to technical glitch. He said he will rebook my flight but I have to pay 31 aed back.I told him to keep the same flight and I will return  refund the money. 
When me and another passenger reached the airport the was entire new shift and they had no clue what is going on with us and they made us wait without telling us what to do next . After some time they just told us to go to ticketing counter again without giving any explanation.

When we went to the ticketing counter there was a lady and we told her what all happened . Then she said she don’t know what’s the issue between customer care and us. I told her this all confusion had happened due to misinformation provided by customer care executives.

I told her at the airport staff or her should automatically reschedule us to the next flight available. But she said she can’t  change our flight and we have to do new booking. Basically we had to buy a new flight ticket  .

This was a really terrible day of my life where I was made to roam around without being me at any fault. None of the staff members except at Delhi airport and only one person at Chandigarh airport were efficient enough to deal with such situation. The all disaster happened because of wrong information provided by customer care executives. They take good enough 15 to 20 minute to check everything and still get back to you with wrong information.
Airport staff/ ticketing staff  is not empathetic enough and not at all interested to sort the problem out. All executives seek help form manager around and not able to sort the problem out and take too 
much time to understand what exactly is going on . 

I was told no flight is available , no seats available but when I boarded the flight which I bought again from hard earned money , I could see so many empty seats. Siting that root cause of this was misinformation provided by you staff the airport staff should have taken initiative to offer  me next flight instead of directing me to buy the new ticket. Seems like no one really cared through what situation a passenger a going on.
